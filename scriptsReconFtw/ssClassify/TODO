Image classification is working fine

What to do:
    - Implement multi-threading

    - There are so many variables in the script, it is becoming hard to handle,
    make another json file that will store which key in `strings.json` belongs to which directory, 
    Now when you have to move the image to respected directory, fetch the value of the key of strings.json from new json file which will be holding respective directory paths. 

What can you do:
    Add more keys and values to strings.json
