This script organises bulk screeshots of subdomains by copying images to some predefined categories based on text extraction.

It exctracts the texts from the image, matches it from some saved text in `string.json`, then copies the image to newly created folder to organise and ease the workload while reviewing bulk screenshots of subdomains in recon phase.
